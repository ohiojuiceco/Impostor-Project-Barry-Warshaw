# Impostor-Project-Barry-Warshaw
This is a local multiplayer "Social Deduction" game built entirely in Python. It’s designed to be played in person by passing a single laptop around the room. One player is secretly chosen as the Impostor, while everyone else gets a Secret Word. The Impostor's goal is to blend in without knowing what the word is!

## How it Works
1. **Setup:** Enter the number of players and their names.
2. **The Secret:** The game picks a secret word from a list of over 100 options. 
3. **The Reveal:** Players take turns looking at the screen. Everyone gets the secret word except for one person—the **Impostor**.
4. **The Screen Clear:** The console clears itself after every turn so no one can sneak a peek at the previous player's word.
5. **Discussion:** Once everyone has seen their role, the group discusses and tries to find out the liar.
6. **The Reveal:** Hit Enter to see who the Impostor was and what the word was!

## Features
* **100+ Words:** A massive built-in word list for endless amount of replays.
* **Beginner Friendly:** Written using fundamental Python concepts (loops, lists, and basic modules).
* **Platforms:** Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
