# Impostor-Project-Barry-Warshaw
This is a local multiplayer "Social Deduction" game built entirely in Python. It’s designed to be played in person by passing a single laptop around the room. One player is secretly chosen as the Impostor, while everyone else gets a Secret Word. The Impostor's goal is to blend in without knowing what the word is!
